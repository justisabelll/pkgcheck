# pkgcheck

a tool that uses ai to give you an idea if an aur package is safe to install

## background

i recently started using arch and i think the aur is cool, but obv downloading random packages can be a bad idea

so i thought it would be a fun project to make a chrome extension that uses ai to do the manual "checking" that we are all supposed to do (but probably don't) before installing an aur package

## how it works
